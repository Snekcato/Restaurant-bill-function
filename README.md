# Restaurant-bill-function
This is the original code from the video tutorial on how to create your own functions. This function returns us the total of a bill including a 10% tip. The main goal for this is so you can parctice on how to create your own personalized functions using the reserved words "def" and "return" in Python.

You can copy and paste this program in your text editor and see what it does, feel free to make your own changes and experiment with it. If you have any comments or ideas on how to improve this, please send an issue so i can revise it.

If you don't know how to create a function, you should watch my tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLv1du0Mu7w&t=287s&ab_channel=SnekCato
